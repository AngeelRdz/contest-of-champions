### Roster Page

  This is the default view where you can view and modify your roster.
    
  Use the side panel to open an Add Champion sub-page as well as filter and sort your champions.
    
  Selecting a champion here lets you update their rank, level and other attributes.

### Team Page

  This is where your teams will be displayed (with extras if the option is selected) once they are built.

  From the build settings panel you can go to the advanced settings page or build a set of teams.

### Guide Page

  These pages give details on each champion: abilities, styles, synergies and availability in crystals.
    
## Synergy Tool

### Synergies Page

  This tool lets you see the synergies between all champions of a given star value.
